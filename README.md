This a collection of projects based around a course I am taking learning about image processing and computer vision.

# Project 1
> Simple enhancement methods to add to an image after background is removed:
# Project 2
> Trying out different 2D filters like averaging filter, sobel filter, median filter, and gaussian filter.
# Project 3
> Applying functions for 2D filtering to detect largest circle in an image. 
# Project 4
> Implement skin segmentation using method of color components thresholding.
# Project 5
> Additional add-ons to project 4 that use morpholigical tools.

adding more implementations as I work on them . . .
